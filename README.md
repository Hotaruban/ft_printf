### The "ft_printf" project challenges participants to implement their own version of the printf function in C. The objective is to develop a custom printf function capable of formatting and printing various data types, including strings, integers, and floating-point numbers, while supporting a range of formatting options.

### Key Points:

**Printf Functionality**: Participants are tasked with recreating the core functionality of the printf function, allowing for versatile formatting and output.

**Format Specifiers**: The project involves handling a variety of format specifiers (e.g., %s for strings, %d for integers, %f for floats) and ensuring accurate formatting based on these specifiers.

**Modifiers and Flags**: Participants implement modifiers and flags to control the display format, precision, and width of the output. This includes handling field width, precision, and alignment.

**Varargs**: Mastery of variable arguments (varargs) is essential for this project, as printf should be able to handle a variable number of arguments.

**Return Value**: The project requires participants to manage the return value of printf, providing a count of characters printed.
